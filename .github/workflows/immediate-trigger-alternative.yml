name: No-Delay Workflow Runner

# ALTERNATIVE APPROACH: No workflow_run delays!
# This triggers immediately when Runners demo completes
# How it works: Specific job cloning
on:
  workflow_dispatch:  # Manual trigger initially
  push:
    branches: [main, rel/**]
    paths:
      - '**.java'  # Or whatever triggers your logic
      
jobs:
  runners-demo:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: "ðŸš€ This can 'run' both workflows immediately"
        run: |
          echo "Runners demo logic here"
          
      - name: "ðŸ“ˆ After Demo Step 1"
        run: |
          echo "Next after demo steps"
          echo "Step conclusion: success/failure"
          
      # Here would be your issue creation logic          
      # Same logic that was in 'create-issue-on-failure' job
      - name: "ðŸ”— Check outcome (immediately)"
        run: |
          echo "Check status immediately"
          # Your create issue logic here
          
    # Always run jobs here that were in the downstream workflow 
    # This way NO delays!
